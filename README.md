# Histogram-Image-Analysis
The Histogram Image Analysis project is a web-based application designed to analyze and visualize the histogram of any image uploaded by the user. The application processes the image, calculates its color distribution, and displays a histogram graph to represent the frequency of pixel values in the image. It provides an insightful view of how colors are distributed within an image, which can be useful for various applications in image processing, computer vision, and digital art.

This project utilizes React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, and it leverages the Chart.js library for visualizing the histograms.

# Features
Upload Images: Users can upload image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) for analysis.
Image Processing: The application processes the uploaded image and calculates the color histogram.
Histogram Visualization: The histogram is displayed using the Chart.js library, showing the distribution of pixel values.
Backend API: The backend API is built using Node.js and Express, which handles image file processing and analysis.
Responsive UI: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

# Technologies Used
Frontend:

React: For building the user interface and handling user interactions.
Chart.js: For visualizing the color histograms.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
Vite: A fast build tool to develop the React application.
Bootstrap: For responsive layout and styling.

Backend:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side logic.
Express: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
Canvas API: Used for image manipulation and histogram generation.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
