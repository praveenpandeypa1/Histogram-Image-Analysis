# Histogram-Image-Analysis
The Histogram Image Analysis project is a web-based application designed to analyze and visualize the histogram of any image uploaded by the user. The application processes the image, calculates its color distribution, and displays a histogram graph to represent the frequency of pixel values in the image. It provides an insightful view of how colors are distributed within an image, which can be useful for various applications in image processing, computer vision, and digital art.

This project utilizes React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, and it leverages the Chart.js library for visualizing the histograms.
